  I am a developer and High school student. Since 2020, with the goal of creating solutions that change people's lives in some way. I currently focus my studies on Java and Spring Framework.
I like to challenge myself with innovative projects and new learning experiences.

```java
System.out.println("Welcome to my Github!");
```
