</br>

  I am a developer and high school student interested in web development, information security, and helping the programming community with my projects.

  I started programming in 2021 during the pandemic, and since then, I have continued to study the area to this day. I currently focus on my studies in Javascript, NodeJs, Docker, React, Tailwind CSS, Information Security, among other technologies that I use to create web applications.

  I enjoy working and challenging myself on random projects in my free time.
